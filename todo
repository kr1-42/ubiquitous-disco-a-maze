--- Project Rules
- Python >= 3.10
- follow flake8 style
- add type hints everywhere + mypy clean
- add docstrings (PEP 257)
- handle errors with clear messages (no crashes)
- use context managers for files/resources
- add .gitignore for Python artifacts
- Makefile targets: install, run, debug, clean, lint, lint-strict(optional)

--- Parsing & Config
- read config.txt line by line
- ignore blank lines and lines starting with '#'
- parse KEY=VALUE (one per line)
- required keys: WIDTH, HEIGHT, ENTRY, EXIT, OUTPUT_FILE, PERFECT
- optional keys: SEED, ALGORITHM, DISPLAY_MODE
- validate integer sizes for WIDTH/HEIGHT (>0)
- validate ENTRY/EXIT format x,y
- validate ENTRY/EXIT inside bounds and different
- validate PERFECT as boolean
- default SEED if missing (runtime only unless spec says persist)

--- Grid Model
- represent each cell with 4 walls (N/E/S/W)
- initialize all walls present
- neighbor lookup by (x,y) with bounds checking

--- Randomness
- initialize RNG with SEED once
- use RNG for all random choices

--- Maze Generation
- choose algorithm (default DFS )
- carve passages while maintaining wall coherence
- ensure full connectivity of open cells
- keep border walls intact except at entry/exit openings

--- Constraints
- prevent 3x3 open areas (allow corridors up to width 2)
- embed visible “42” using fully closed cells
- if maze too small for “42”: print error and omit pattern
- ensure “42” cells do not violate required connectivity rules

--- Perfect Flag
- if PERFECT=True: enforce unique path between entry/exit (perfect maze)
- if PERFECT=False: loops allowed

--- Validation Pass
- verify wall coherence between neighbors
- verify entry/exit openings at borders
- verify full connectivity (excluding closed “42” cells if allowed)
- verify no 3x3 open areas

--- Output
- write hex wall grid (1 hex digit per cell)
- rows per line, then empty line
- append entry coords, exit coords, shortest path (N/E/S/W), each on its own line
- all lines end with \n
- render visual (ASCII or MLX)
- allow interactions: regenerate, show/hide shortest path, change wall colors

--- Testing
- test with fixed seeds for reproducibility
- test boundary entry/exit cases
- test small sizes (1x1, 2x2, 3x3)
- test perfect vs non-perfect behavior
- test output file validator
